# Analog Glove

A work-in-progress, BLE-enabled analog input glove using flex sensors, real-time ADC sampling, and USB HID output.  
Currently, the core features are being developed and validated through smaller experimental projects, as follows:

- [ ] BLE – Scanning, connecting, notifications (Mostly complete) [Notion Page](https://jolly-cycle-c67.notion.site/Analog-Glove-228ed72549008087aae9fa4d90f2193a?pvs=74)
- [ ] ADC – Flex sensor input via SAADC
- [ ] HID – USB keyboard output (via dongle)
- [ ] CLI – On-device configuration and debug tools
